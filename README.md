# Toronto Trains Subway Delay
This EDA project uses python and a series of jupyter notebooks to analyse train delays in Toronto over the last few years.
This data originates in the City of Toronto Open Data project [here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data/).


### Objective:
- What can we learn about delays?
- Can we predict them?
- Can we prevent them?
